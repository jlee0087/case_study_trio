# Case study -- Trio
Second case study from David, involving a trio and merged vcf.

## Background of the case
Child appears to have some form of lipodystrophy, noted from the absence of fat from her body. Child has no neurological disorders, as she participates in her grade school class completely fine. Both parents do not have any conditions similar to the case whatsoever.


David mentions that there are two main scenarios to focus on with this child:
    1. De novo, dominant negative. Child has a variant that the parents do not, and only needing one copy of it to have the disorder
    2. Autosomal recessive. Child has received two hits(either true genetic autosomal recessive, or compound heterozygous) from her parents.
